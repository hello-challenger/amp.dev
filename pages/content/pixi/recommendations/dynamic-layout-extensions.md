We noticed that some components
with dynamic layout are being used on your AMP page. While these can provide
useful and unique user experiences on your AMP page, they can also have a
negative impact on CLS. If you are having trouble meeting performance
thresholds while using these components, please [file an issue on GitHub](https://github.com/ampproject/amphtml/issues/new?assignees=&labels=Type%3A+Page+experience&template=page-experience.md&title=Page+experience+issue) so AMP can help you improve your page.

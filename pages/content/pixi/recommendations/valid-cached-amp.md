AMP doesn't just make your pages fast, it validates your page's speed!
Validation makes third parties, such as Twitter, Instagram, or Google Search,
feel great about serving AMP pages in new and interesting ways.
Creating valid AMP pages makes your content available for caching in
[AMP caches](https://amp.dev/documentation/guides-and-tutorials/learn/amp-caches-and-cors/how_amp_pages_are_cached/#what-amp-caches-are-available?),
which is essentially access to free CDNs!   
<br><br>
Learn how to build valid AMP pages by following 
[our guide](https://amp.dev/documentation/guides-and-tutorials/learn/validation-workflow/validate_amp/),
and use [the AMP validator](http://validator.amp.dev/#url=${URL}) to identify any issues!

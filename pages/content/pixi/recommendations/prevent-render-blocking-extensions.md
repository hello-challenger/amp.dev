We noticed that some
render-blocking components are being used on your AMP page. While these can
provide useful and unique user experiences on your AMP page, they can also have
a negative impact on LCP. If you are having trouble meeting performance
thresholds while using these components, please [file an issue on GitHub](https://github.com/ampproject/amphtml/issues/new?assignees=&labels=Type%3A+Page+experience&template=page-experience.md&title=Page+experience+issue) so AMP
can help you improve your page.

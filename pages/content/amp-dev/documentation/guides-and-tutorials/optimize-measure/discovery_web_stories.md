Include a [favicon](https://www.w3.org/2005/10/howto-favicon) to display as the icon in the browser tab.

## Document title

Give your Web Story document a title by including a <code>[<title>](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/title)</code> tag.

## Page attachments
Use [page attachments](https://amp.dev/documentation/components/amp-story-page-attachment/) to present additional information in “classic article form” alongside your Web Story. This can be useful to provide extra detail, deep dives, or onward journeys for the content presented in your Story.

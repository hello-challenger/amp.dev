Email clients require sender registration to display AMP emails to users. Follow this guide to get your sender address allow listed on supporting clients! 

# Create and send production-ready AMP email

You must demonstrate an understanding and compliance of the AMP email format. Emails must:


*   Pass [SPF/DKIM/DMARC](https://support.google.com/a/answer/33786?hl=en) with matching TLD with "From:" address
*   Have a fallback "text/html" MIME part
*   Comply with all client sender requirements


Send a production-ready AMP email to the following addresses:

*   ampverification@yahoo.com
*   postmaster\_amp@corp.mail.ru
*   ampforemail.whitelisting@gmail.com


# Fill out global form

You must fill out the [AMP for Email: Sender Registration form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdso95e7UDLk_R-bnpzsAmuUMDQEMUgTErcfGGItBDkghHU2A/viewform?gxids=7628). This is the only form you need to fill out to be allowlisted to send AMP emails for all supporting email clients. 

# Follow privacy policies

You must follow each client's privacy policy.

# Why you should be sending AMP Emails

AMP Emails are:

- Interactive: Offer new opportunities for readers to engage and take action directly in an email.
- Versatile: Include multiple categories, links, and CTAs â€“ which can lead to more user engagement.
- Smarter: Reduce the number of clicks, increase adoptions, and improve down-funnel engagement. 

With AMP For Email, you can make your users more productive and happier. You can allow them to do things in your app, without leaving the email.

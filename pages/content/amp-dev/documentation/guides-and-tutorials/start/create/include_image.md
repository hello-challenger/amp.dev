Most HTML tags can be used directly in AMP, but certain tags, such as the `<img>` tag, must be replaced with their AMP equivalents. See [HTML tags in the specification](../../learn/spec/amphtml.md) for a full list.

We’ll add an image to our page, the AMP way, with the [`<amp-img>`](../../../components/reference/amp-img.md) tag. Copy and paste the code below into the `<body>`.

```html
<amp-img src="https://source.unsplash.com/random/600x400" width="600" height="400"></amp-img>
``` 

[tip type="note"]

AMP replaces certain default HTML tags for the following reasons:

*   To project the layout of the page before assets load. This ensures [layout stability](https://web.dev/cls) for a better user experience. 
*   To control network requests so that resources are lazy loaded and resources are prioritized effectively. 

The AMP team is working to support native `<img>` tags on valid AMP pages. See [this GitHub issue](https://github.com/ampproject/amphtml/issues/30442) for more information and current progress.

## Make your image responsive

One of the powerful benefits of AMP is its [layout system](../../learn/amp-html-layout/index.md). AMP's layout system makes it very easy to implement responsive images that automatically adjust their size to the available space on a page. The best thing is: it does this in a way that ensures layout stability and [avoids content jumps](https://web.dev/cls/). We can quickly make our image responsive by adding `layout="responsive"` to the `<amp-img>` tag. Try it yourself by updating your `amp-img` to match the code below then change the preview window size in the playground.

```html
<amp-img src="https://source.unsplash.com/Ji_G7Bu1MoM/600x400" width="600" height="400" layout="responsive"></amp-img>
```

Our image now fits snugly in our viewport and grows or shrinks when the viewport size changes!

## Modify layout

While non-AMP pages may almost exclusively use CSS to layout elements, AMP enforces stricter rules to avoid content layout shift and other performance reasons. All AMP components require a layout and each layout has different dimension declaration requirements. For example, our image has the `responsive` layout, which requires `width` and `height`. If you remove the `width` attribute from the `<amp-img>` the playground will display a validation error! But, don’t fret, there are several ways we can fix this! One way is to add the `width` attribute back, but another is to change the defined `layout` attribute. Try updating `“responsive”` to `“fixed-height”`. 

```html
<amp-img src="https://source.unsplash.com/Ji_G7Bu1MoM/600x400" height="400" layout="fixed-height"></amp-img>
```

And there, our validation error is gone! This type of flexibility in layout lets us work with what we know, such as a pre-determined height but not the width, while still guaranteeing a good experience for end users! View all the available layouts in [Demonstrating AMP layouts](../../learn/amp-html-layout/layouts_demonstrated.html) and learn about how AMP renders and layouts a page and how you can modify the layout in [Layout & Media queries](../../develop/style_and_layout/control_layout.md).

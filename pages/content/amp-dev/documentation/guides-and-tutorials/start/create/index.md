In this tutorial, we’ll introduce you to the basics of an AMP page. Follow these steps to get started learning how AMP is unique, checking if a page is valid, and taking next steps to publishing it to the web.

AMP pages that pass validation enable caching and are more likely to meet [Page Experience metrics](../../../../about/page-experience.html)! If you are uninterested in [AMP cache benefits](../../learn/amp-caches-and-cors/how_amp_pages_are_cached.md) or unable to switch to fully valid AMP but still want to use AMP's components, check out [Bento AMP](../bento_guide.md?format=websites).

[tip type="note"]
If you’re new to web development, you can learn the basics and AMP at the same time! Check out [AMP’s web development courses](../../../courses/?format=websites&level=beginner) to get started.

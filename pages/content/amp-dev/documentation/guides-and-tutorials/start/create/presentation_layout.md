AMP pages are web pages — any styling to the page and its elements is done using standard CSS properties. However, AMP requires that all CSS is included within a custom `style` tag in the head of the document, called `<style amp-custom>`. The `<style amp-custom>` tag must go inside the`<head>` of the document. Styles may also be defined inlined if needed. Try adding the following styles to your page:

```css
  <style amp-custom>
    h1 {
      margin: 1rem;
    }
     body {
      background-color: blue;
    }
  </style>
```

AMP allows almost all CSS, but there are a few selectors that must be avoided. [Learn about those and more about styling in AMP here](../../develop/style_and_layout/style_pages.md).

    headline: Problem
    text: "It’s truer in today’s fast-paced industries than ever: Clients of services businesses expect immediate results. But in the relay race to deliver, services firms are leaving cash on the table due to disconnected data. With department silos blocking visibility and slowing service delivery, productivity goes down and non-billable tasks, billing cycles and invoice disputes go up.<br><br>By connecting teams inside of one efficient end-to-end solution, VOGSY provides the infrastructure needed to combat these issues. Seeing an opportunity to ensure the quote-to-cash baton would never be dropped, VOGSY adopted AMP For Email to send actionable workflow emails directly to its users’ inboxes."

    text: "Busy services professionals live in their inbox. With its new dynamic email feature built on AMP For Email, VOGSY sends timely project updates and workflows to its users in Gmail, where they will be seen immediately and put into action. As a result, baton handovers are now expertly executed at the critical moment.<br><br>Among over 60 workflows and notifications that VOGSY now delivers in AMP emails, invoice and timesheet approvals are among the most time-sensitive for preventing cash drainage. Within these dynamic emails, VOGSY presents the timesheets and invoices along with the associated project information and buttons to approve or reject. Approvers can review for accuracy and complete the approvals, or interact with team members, all within the email itself. Any decision and comment is automatically logged to the appropriate client project in VOGSY."
